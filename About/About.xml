	<description>This mod expands the social and mood system by adding new traits, interactions, and thoughts. The stories that emerge from your pawns' quirks are the most fun part of RimWorld, and this mod aims to expand on that emergent storytelling by increasing variety.
	
Psychology does not require a new save game.

&lt;b&gt;New Traits&lt;/b&gt;  
- Prude: This old-fashioned pawn hates the sight of nudity, and is mortified by the thought that others might be able to see their private areas. They are eternally disapproving of nudists and bothered by wearing ratty clothing.
- Insomniac: This pawn has a sleeping disorder. They will rarely attempt to sleep, and will never be fully satisfied by doing so. They spend most of their time awake, and thus, productive; but almost always tired.
- Bleeding Heart: This pawn is a big old softie. They will be pleased by doing things that help others, and more traumatized by brutal or senseless acts like mistreatment of prisoners or violence. They also will not get along with psychopaths.
- Gourmet: This demanding pawn expects to eat well every day. They'll be more satisfied by doing so, but more annoyed by having to eat things other than what they want.
- Unstable: This fluctuating pawn experiences random mood swings multiple times a day, and to a greater degree than other pawns, with manic and depressive episodes.
- Lecher: This unabashedly sexual pawn only cares about their own desires. They'll hit on anyone they find attractive, regardless of how they personally feel about them or if they are likely to be reciprocated. Anyone who accepts the advances of this pawn is likely to have their heart broken.
- Codependent: This pawn needs the comfort of intimacy. They will be unhappy when alone, and devastated by breakups and affairs. On the plus side, they are loyal and happy when they have someone to latch on to.
- Outdoorsy: This pawn enjoys spending time in the open. They get a mood boost when there's no roof above their head, and are affected by cabin fever more severely.
- Pluviophile: This pawn simply likes the sound and feel of rain, and will receive a mood bonus from it.
- Photosensitive: This pawn, either through gene modding or random mutation, has eyes that are extremely sensitive to the light. They will be very unhappy at being exposed to it, but find darkness comforting.
- Socialite: This fun-loving pawn is great at parties, and so your colony will hold them more often as long as they're around. (name credit Wellech)
- Desensitized: This numbed pawn no longer gets mood penalties for witnessing death or observing corpses. They will still be upset by colonists' deaths in general, and by other moral outrages. This trait can potentially be gained during play whenever a pawn sees someone die or looks at a body.
- Heavy Sleeper: This comatose pawn cannot receive mood penalties for disturbed sleep, but is also difficult to wake up.
- Polyamorous: This pawn has too much love to share with just one person. They will be unhappy in relationships with non-polygamous pawns, and can romance multiple people.
- Open-Minded: This pawn doesn't suffer negative opinion penalties for people's appearances, and won't take appearance into account in romance.

&lt;b&gt;New Thoughts&lt;/b&gt;  
- Adrenaline Rush: Pawns get a short mood boost when killing a hostile from an enemy faction. This gives them some relief at having defended their home.
- Dreams: Pawns may have dreams while sleeping which can affect their mood.
- Passionate Work: Pawns will be a little happier while doing something they have a burning passion for. (idea credit ({x}) Disarray)
- Imprisonment: They may be willing to join your colony, but pawns you've captured and recruited will be resentful and awkward with the people that imprisoned them, until they get used to their new life.
- Individuality: Pawns don't like looking the same as everybody else. They will get a gradually worsening mood penalty depending on how many other colony members are wearing a perfectly matching outfit.

&lt;b&gt;New Mental Breaks&lt;/b&gt;  
- Berserk (extreme): The same mental break you know and love, but its frequency is greatly reduced. Bloodlust pawns now have the greatest chance to go berserk, followed by psychopaths, then brawlers. (idea credit twoski)
- Sadism (extreme): The pawn will go after the colony's prisoners and pets, as well as wild animals, and brutalize them. Psychopaths have the greatest chance to become sadistic, followed by bloodlust pawns, then brawlers. (idea credit twoski)
- Self-harm (extreme): The pawn will cut their hands and arms and hide in their room. Masochists have the greatest chance to self-harm. (idea credit twoski)
- Tantrum (extreme): The pawn will destroy nearby furniture and buildings. (idea credit twoski)
- Abuse (extreme): The pawn will wander around the colony, finding people to harass and insult. Abrasive pawns have the greatest chance to break this way, followed by unstable pawns. (idea credit twoski)
- Fell plotting (extreme): The pawn will retire to their room to hatch some terrible scheme, if you don't stop them. Psychopaths have the greatest chance to break this way, followed by bloodlust pawns.
- Paranoia (extreme): The pawn will wander aimlessly, depressing the people around them with their paranoid ramblings.
- Compulsion (major): The pawn relentlessly cleans and organizes their surroundings, usually until they pass out from exhaustion. (idea credit twoski)
- Antisocial (minor): The pawn will wander out into the wilderness, avoiding their fellow colonists. (idea credit twoski)
- Apathy (minor): The pawn becomes lethargic and will frequently wander around instead of working. They cannot be manually assigned to tasks or drafted while apathetic. (idea credit twoski)
- Histrionic (minor): The pawn desperately seeks attention and validation, wandering around the colony trying to talk to people. Occasionally, they will flirt with someone or propose to their partner. Socialite pawns have the greatest chance to break this way, followed by Lechers.

&lt;b&gt;New Illnesses&lt;/b&gt;  
- Anxiety: Pawns with this illness can have panic attacks, more frequent the worse their anxiety is. Severe anxiety also increases a pawn's mental break threshold, makes it more difficult for them to talk, and causes them to sleep more often. Long-term treatment can reduce anxiety to a level where it does not interfere with a pawn's daily routine. The younger the pawn, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and the more severe it is likely to be. Pawns can also develop anxiety after having a mental break.

&lt;b&gt;New Treatments&lt;/b&gt;
- Some traits can be treated by assigning them a bill through the Operations screen. If successful, they will gain a status effect that nullifies the trait, at the cost of being a little more on edge. It must be maintained through use of good medicine, or they may lapse.
- Pyromaniac: Will no longer go on fire-starting sprees.
- Chemical interest/fascination: Will no longer go on drug binges.

&lt;b&gt;New Drugs&lt;/b&gt;  
- Methadone: An opioid used to treat drug addiction. Barely addictive itself, it is useful for keeping colonists functional while they are suffering from withdrawal. Cheap and easy to manufacture.

&lt;b&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/b&gt; 
- Kinsey scale: Instead of using up trait slots for sexualities, pawns are assigned a rating on the Kinsey scale which governs their romantic interactions. They'll also remember the sexualities of people they've attempted to romance, and avoid it in the future if they are incompatible.
- Empathy: Non-Bleeding Heart pawns incur slightly smaller mood penalties for thoughts that Bleeding Heart pawns get more upset about.
- Romance: Non-Lecher pawns will not attempt to romance pawns who are in a good relationship, and the likelihood of non-Lecher pawns in a relationship to attempt to romance other pawns is influenced by the strength of their relationship.
- Social Traits: Pawns will not be affected by social traits relating to appearance if they can't see, or by social traits relating to talking if they can't hear. Pawns whose social traits involve talking also won't affect others with them if they can't talk.
- Arresting: Pawns now have a "peaceful arrest chance" stat based on their Social skill, which is used when determining whether someone refuses arrest.

&lt;b&gt;COMPATIBILITY&lt;/b&gt;
- Place Psychology as low in your load order as possible, and it will disable its features for compatibility with other mods.
- Psychology adds new properties to pawns. Colonies with Psychology enabled on them may break if the mod is disabled. Colonies without Psychology enabled on them will only receive new functionality on new pawns. Disabling the Kinsey scale for old saves is recommended.
- Psychology detours some of the game's functionality, so other mods which alter the game's code may not work properly if loaded after Psychology. Mods which only modify Defs are 100% compatible with Psychology, as Psychology does not override any core Defs.


MOD AUTHORS: You can use the source code provided with the mod to build compatibility into your mod. Use reflection to access Psychology's traits and thoughts and check if the mod is loaded, then include the mod's functionality in any classes you detour. Then tell your users to load your mod before Psychology, so that it can perform both mods' work (or only yours, if they are not using Psychology). Example:

ThoughtDef kp = DefDatabase&lt;ThoughtDef&gt;.GetNamedSilentFail("KilledPatientBleedingHeart");
if(kp != null)
    surgeon.needs.mood.thoughts.memories.TryGainMemoryThought(kp, patient);
	
This will try to give the pawn Psychology's Bleeding Heart thought, but ONLY if it detects that that thought actually exists (which means Psychology is loaded). Otherwise, it does nothing, because the user isn't using Psychology.
